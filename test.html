<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Yahara has years of experience, training and education in the Life Sciences arena. Our partners and staff members have years of experience in laboratory environments and in fact many of us possess degrees in life science fields. It&rsquo;s no coincidence, then, that this is a market we specialize in - our project teams possess the unique combination of industry knowledge and technical skills needed to successfully collaborate with clients to meet specific goals quickly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">While many companies can provide data solutions for life science organizations, very few, if any, can match our domain knowledge. Most IT companies will likely have to ask very basic questions in order to even get started with your project and might never fully grasp the science, technology and&nbsp; procedures that your business is based upon.&nbsp; That is not the case for us, we get it right away, hit the ground running and deliver the precise results you need to succeed within an optimal timeframe.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">A FOCUS ON BIOTECH</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">We are especially well-suited in serving biotech-based companies of all kinds, we have experience working with everyone in this area from those that manufacture biological end products - cell lines, biological reagents, etc. - to those that develop instrumentation to gather vast amounts of complex data.&nbsp; We have shown that we can be much more than a run of the mill software development vendor, in many cases we have built partnerships with our clients to further advance scientific discovery, produce innovative product developments and to find important insights through complex data analytics. &nbsp;Our commitment to the Life Sciences community extends well beyond our project engagements, Yahara partners and employees are heavily involved in the biotechnology community through our sponsored events and participation in life sciences activities in the Madison local area as well as our work with national trade groups that focus on the advancement of this very important industry</span></p>

<p>The key processes within most life science based organizations require the combination of multiple data sources to create value that is more than the sum of its parts. Whether integrating lab systems with instrumentation, biotech companies with ecommerce solutions, or developing a novel custom application, we bridge the gaps to help our clients make the most of their data. </p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re like data plumbers &ndash; we know how to connect your LIMS, Instrumentation, ERP, E-commerce and external partner systems so that all data flows seamlessly into a common platform.  In this way, the information can be efficiently used for numerous strategic business initiatives from basic reporting to more detailed operational analytics that offer insights into your scientific operations.  We build systems that support robust integration capabilities in order to support the collecting and collating of the data our clients need to produce information that is vital to their business. While many companies can provide you with skilled resources to gather and aggregate data, we understand the disparate data systems you are working with and integrate them using a proven architecture that provides you with a single access point from which you can build your analytical solutions and thus enhancing your ability to complete your core research and business functions.

<p>Laboratories and Biotech businesses generate huge amounts of data.  First off, these operations have the typical business systems such as ERP, CRM and Accounting platforms that keep track of general business operations.  This type of business then integrates these systems with the complex systems required to operate such as LIMS, Robotics/Instrumentation and Quality Assurance Tracking applications.   We have the unique ability to apply our technical expertise with our deep operational understanding of the information that users, managers and executives in these types of companies need to be highly productive. Whether looking at experimental outcomes, biotech production parameters or compliance data, Yahara is able to apply common analytics techniques on top of your biotech and laboratory data to deliver the information your organization needs to create great scientific workflows. </p>
<p>
On the health sciences front, we primarily work with independent healthcare quality focused organizations that provide health quality reporting services on behalf of their clients or governmental agencies.  We have proven that we can provide value in aggregating large payer, provider and laboratory result data streams to provide meaningful analytics.  This information allows our partners to provide the information they need to optimize their processes and even apply for federal grants based upon the metrics they are able to collect. </p>
<p>
Visualization integration &ndash; We understand that many times the information generated within science based organizations simply cannot be effectively visualized using bar charts and simple gauges, so we assist our clients in selecting the right visualization tool to fit with their specific needs, making sure they can make sense of it in a way the can share it with their organization. This includes creating custom dashboards [LINK: Data &amp; Dashboards] to easily monitor KPIs and other vital data.

<p>Yahara has worked with many instrument vendors over the years and has built a software that leverages the best functionality of our clients&rsquo; instruments and provides an intuitive interface for the end users of the product. Our ability to get up-to-speed quickly and handle data acquisition, instrument control, and data analytics and reports for a broad spectrum of instrument technologies makes us an ideal full development partner.

<p>Our domain expertise lends itself to successfully setting up ecommerce platforms for labs. These applications require more information than a typical online transaction, and without in-depth industry knowledge, it can be very challenging to implement the right solutions. We are capable of setting-up a range of complex ecommerce platforms to fit very specific needs, including those that provide simple placement of orders for consumables all the way to supporting complex sample submission and remote testing ordering for laboratories.
